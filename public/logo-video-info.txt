Add your logo.mp4 file here for the welcome screen animation.

The welcome screen component expects a video file at /logo.mp4

If you don't have a video file, the component will show a fallback rocket emoji (🚀) instead.

To add your video:
1. Place your video file in this public folder
2. Name it "logo.mp4"
3. The video should be around 4 seconds long for best experience
